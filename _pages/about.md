# Overview
I'm a Junior currently attending Havre de Grace High School. I am in the magnet program for Information Technology Oracle Academy. I plan to go to University of Maryland College Park and major in Computer Science. As of right now some of my hobbies are, but not limited to, coding in various languages, video games, working out, and learning about computer hardware.


# Education

### *Python courses* 
June 2020 â€“ July 2021 

During middle school, I was enrolled in a STEM course at my middle school and an outside-of-school online python course. Though it was an introductory course, I quickly advanced to an intermediate course (as instructed by my tutor). From there I was able to firmly understand object-oriented programming.

###  *High School* 
Sep 2022-Present 

I am currently a high school student enrolled in Havre De Grace as a magnet student. I am a part of the ITOA (information technology oracle academy). Here, I am enrolled in several AP courses and computer science courses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  *Dual Enrollment*
Sep 2024 - Present

I am currently taking college classes through Harford Community College (HCC) because I wanted to take these courses to get some high school and college credits out of the way. During my senior year I am looking to take some computer science courses for further knowledge in my computer science field.

### *College* 
Janurary 2025 - Future

I also will be taking college level computer programming courses in 2025. I plan to major in computer science at UMD which is why I want to take some college level classes at this moment to help me understand what college will have in store for me.

# Professional experience
December 2014 - Present 

### *Local family business* 

I have been helping around in my family business which allowed me to understand customer service. It also taught me how to work efficiently and how to manage my time.

### *Computer Technician, J&M Systems* 
June 2024 - August 2024 

In the summer of 2024, I got accepted into a paid internship at J & M systems. It was my first time in a professional environment which allowed me to experience how to act in a company both socially and when working in a company.
