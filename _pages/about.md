I'm a Junior currently attending Havre de Grace High School. I am in the magnet program for Information Technology Oracle Academy. Put some more here...


# Education

June 2020 â€“ July 2021 
### *Python courses* 

During middle school, I was enrolled in a STEM course at my middle school and an outside-of-school online python course. Though it was an introductory course, I quickly advanced to an intermediate course (as instructed by my tutor). From there I was able to firmly understand object-oriented programming.
